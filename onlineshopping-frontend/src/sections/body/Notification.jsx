        <h3>
          The e-commerce website you're visiting was built entirely by me,
          without spending any money. Please note that when you first try to
          sign in or sign up, there might be a 3-4 minute wait. This is because
          the backend is hosted on Render, which, with the free version, has a
          delay of about 50 seconds for the initial connection after a period of
          inactivity. However, this delay only happens the first time you access
          it. Additionally, the product images are fetched through an API that
          has a limit of 200 images per hour for the free version. So, you might
          not see all images immediately, but don't worryâ€”once fetched, the
          images are stored in your browser cache. If you revisit the site those
          already fetched images are available and the api fetches some new
          images.
